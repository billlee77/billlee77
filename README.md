With 9 years of diverse experience in sales, customer support, social media, and team management, I am a highly adaptable and versatile professional looking to transition into the field of front-end web development. As a junior developer, I may not have extensive experience yet, but what I lack in experience, I make up for in passion and drive to learn. I am deeply passionate about creating responsive and beautiful websites using modern JavaScript, and I am constantly seeking to improve my skills and knowledge in this field. I am a quick learner and a team player, and I am confident that my unique blend of skills and experience will make me an asset to any development team. I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact. I am looking for an opportunity to join a company where I can grow and learn as a front-end developer and where I can put my skills to use in real-world projects.

### ‚úçüèª I am writing about JavaScript to improve my knowledge but also to help beginner fellow developers understand programming from another angle. Follow the Medium link to read the articles!
